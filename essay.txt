How I spent my last weekend.

My mother woke me up about 5 am in last Saturday. When I got up and looked around I saw that everybody dressed nicely. My father asked me to dress quickly to visit one of my aunt's home in Kandy. We arrived at aunt's place at about 11 am. They warmly welcomed us and we had our lunch there. In the evening all of us went to the temple of the tooth. After that, we had a nice boat journey in Bogambara lake. We saw how beautiful the Kandy city is. Then, we had our dinner at a nice restaurant in Kandy. The food was delicious. In the next day, we returned back home with a lot of memories.
